# tracker2jira

This is a project to mirror a Pivotal Tracker and JIRA Project behind a firewall. The goal is to multiplex multiple JIRA free accounts (probably a violation of the ToS) to a single JIRA account within a corporate firewall. The service will run within the firewall and reach out to the Pivotal Tracker projects since they are more open and friendly than JIRA.
